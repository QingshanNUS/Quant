Supervised Learning: Classification/Regression
Unsupervised Learning
Reinforcement Learning

Supervised Learning Algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Recurrent Neural Networks

Bias: Machine refuses to learning anything from training - Variance: Learnings only the training data set

DataSet - Training - Validation - Test
